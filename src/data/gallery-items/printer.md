In the midst of the pandemic, I became very concerned with the potential respiratory side effects of the fumes coming off my 3D printer, for obvious reasons. To mitigate them, I built a fume hood out of the cheapest bathroom fan I could find at Home Depot, a dryer hose, and some overpriced lumber and plastic.
<!-- Powered off the printer's power supply, it pumps air in through small gaps in the front and out the dryer hose through a carbon filter into the backyard. Hopefully that's enough to keep it from harming the squirrels. -->

The 3D printer itself is a DIY hackjob based on the popular and open-source [Prusa i3 MK2](https://github.com/prusa3d/Original-Prusa-i3/tree/MK2).

I might build another fume hood later, for one of my bestest of friends.
