I did my Master's thesis on skip lists in persistent memory. You can read [this brief announcement](ba-skiplist-spaa2021.pdf) on some of my thesis' work that was published at SPAA 2021. I'll write more about it here once I stop seeing stack traces in my nightmares.
<!-- I'll upload it here as soon as the paperwork to let me upload it to the UWaterloo website is complete. -->
