I've had half a portfolio website built and kept on the backburner of my solid state drive for years now, but with my Master's finished it's time I got a polished product out I can use to showcase my most interesting works. This site's built using Gatsby, which is a JavaScript framework for generating static sites with React and GraphQL. To add new portfolio items, I just add a new Markdown file and some images to the data folder of my website. GraphQL and React handle the rest.

You can check out the code for this website here on GitHub. I'll be improving it every once in a while, so check back soon.
