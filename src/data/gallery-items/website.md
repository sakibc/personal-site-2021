I've had half a portfolio website on the backburner of my solid state drive for years now, but with my Master's finished it's time I got it publishable so I can showcase my work. What you're looking at now is a minimal viable product.

This site's built using Gatsby. To add new portfolio items, I just add a new Markdown file to the data folder of my website. React and GraphQL handle the rest.

You can check out the code for my website [here on GitHub](https://github.com/sakibc/personal-site-2021). I'll be improving it every once in a while, so check back soonâ„¢.
