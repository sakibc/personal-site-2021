# Sakib's Personal Website

This is the code for my personal website. It's built on Gatsby, which lets me add new items to the gallery with a simple drag-and-drop. There's still a lot of work to be done, but at least it's presentable right now.

To run a live server, use "npm run develop" or "npm run develop-remote".
